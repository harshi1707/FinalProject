👨‍💻 Harshitha (Sequential Models: LSTM, GRU, Transformers)
Models Assigned:

LSTM – Baseline sequential forecasting

GRU – Lightweight sequence predictor

Autoencoder – Fraud anomaly detection

Deep Q-Network (DQN) – RL for discrete token release

🔹 Needs time-series transaction + market data.

Credit Card Fraud (Kaggle) – highly imbalanced fraud detection dataset (benchmark).

Yahoo Finance / Binance OHLCV (via API) – price time series to test allocation stability.

Use case: Predict future frauds/imbalances in token allocation from sequences.

👩‍💻 Nandini(Graph Models: GNN, GraphSAGE)
Role: Graph Modeling Specialist (wallet-to-wallet relationships, fraud networks)

Models Assigned:

Graph Neural Network (GNN) – Basic wallet graph analysis

Graph Attention Network (GAT) – Detecting whale/collusion influence

Temporal GNN (TGN/TGAT) – Dynamic graph modeling for evolving fraud

Hybrid (GNN + Transformer) – Joint modeling of graph + sequence
🔹 Needs graph-structured data (wallets as nodes, transactions as edges).

Elliptic Dataset (Bitcoin Transaction Graph, Kaggle/Cambridge) – best for fraud detection with graphs.

Ethereum BigQuery (graph features: wallet-to-wallet Tx).

Use case: Detect fraud patterns, whale manipulation, clustering wallets.

Role: Optimization & Deployment Specialist (market simulation + decision-making)

Models Assigned:

Transformers (TFT, Informer, FEDformer) – Long-horizon prediction

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) – Continuous action RL

Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) – Parallelized RL baseline

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) – Stochastic continuous optimization

🔹 Needs transaction outlier data.

Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle) – strong base for anomaly model benchmarking.
